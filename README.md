# First-Steps-in-TypeScript

Project created during the TypeScript Classes.

It's a very simple project, just to get used to the TypeScript language, syntax and package structure.

To execute the project:
- npm run start

There is a moc API in folder servidor-api, run the command: npm run start on that folder as well.
